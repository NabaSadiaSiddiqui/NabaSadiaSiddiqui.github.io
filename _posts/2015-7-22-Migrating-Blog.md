title: Migrating blog from Wordpress to Jekyll
---

So till few months ago (maybe half a year?) I had been blogging at [sodarave](https://sodarave.wordpress.com/) using WordPress. Life became a bit hectic as school got busy and, as a result, my blogging life became dormant. Incidently, when I decided to pick up on blogging again I came across an article ['Blogging like a Hacker'](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) by Tom Preston-Werner (of GitHub fame). It is a fairly old article which talks about using Jekyll and GitHub pages to host your own blog. Now I am a Software Engineer and the idea of using command-line, GitHub/Git and a site generator to write and manage your blog really got me excited! I was on-board.

Few google searches led me to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub. The result is this blog you are now reading. Like my previous blog, the focus of this blog will be all-things technology/coding/hacking.

Let blogging resume...
