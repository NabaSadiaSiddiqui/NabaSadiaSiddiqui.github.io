Blogging is easy. But to continue blogging is difficult. I have always enjoyed writing. However, it takes practise and will to make it a consistent hobby. This time around, I hope I stick with it :smiley:

It has been almost 2 years since I last blogged. A lot has happened in the last 2 years. I changed 2 jobs (onto my 3rd stint next week!). I re-connected with old friends, and made some new ones. I actually enjoy being on social media now :laughing:. I have always been very ambitious about my career and where I want to be in life, and I have taken concrete steps to that effect - co-founding a startup Espresso Claims in the last year and joining Ammi Service to carry forward their mission. It has been an incredible time for me; finding great mentors, completing my Masters (Convocation ceremony is next week!), growing personally, learning and improving myself. I plan to continue using this platform to document my journey as I learn, grow and improve - everything from my failed attempts to get on Kaggle to the Machine Learning algorithm I am learning on Coursera to my backpacking trip in BC. Stick around :smiley:
