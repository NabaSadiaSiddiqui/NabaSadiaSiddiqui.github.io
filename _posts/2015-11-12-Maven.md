title: Maven in a nutshell
---
 
Commonly described as a **build tool**, [Maven] is a **project management tool**.
 
The common tasks of all build tools include:

1. Processing resources
2. Compiling source
3. Executing unit tests
4. Creating an executable artifact (e.g. jar)
5. Installing executable in a local repository
 
What makes Maven more than just a *build tool* is that in addition to the aforementioned capabilities, it can run reports, generate a web site and facilitate communication in a team. Like [Ant], Maven too can be used to build deployable artifacts from source code. But it can also be used to maintain a model of a project through dependency management, project lifecycle, project description, etc.
 
The power of Maven over older build tools is that it employs **convention over configuration**. This means if you have organized your code structure according to the convention expected by Maven, your Maven configuration file (*POM - Project Object Model*) is comparitively more concise and has a faster project execution.
