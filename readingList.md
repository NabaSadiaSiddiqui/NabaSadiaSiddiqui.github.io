I used to be an avid reader, and want to start reading again. I like to read all kinds of books - technical books, current affairs, fiction, self-help. Inspired by leaders like Bill Gates, I want to share the books I have read or reading. This is by no means a way to influence your bookshelf :) This is in addition to the record I maintain on Goodreads.
